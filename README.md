## Abstract
High-density glass scintillators may improve integrating-mode proton radiography detectors by improving resolution and decreasing detector size. Several new scintillators, activated with europium or terbium, 
were evaluated with measurements and Monte Carlo simulations, characterizing light yield,  ionization quenching and proton radiograph spatial resolution. A correction for ionization quenching was applied based on an 
analytical model. The data demonstrate increased light yield with increased activation element concentration, and higher light yields for samples activated with europium. Increased glass density provided more compact 
detector geometries and higher spatial resolution. These findings will aid in selecting the optimal scintillator for a full-size proton radiography detector.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for reproducing the figures.

## Google Colab
Opening the project in Google Colab, the dependencies are already installed and you can easily run the entire code with no setup. As of 2024 the free version of Google Colab has enough resources to reproduce the figures.

### Prerequisites
The following libraries are required:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- SciPy
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using `pip`.

### Installing
To set up your environment to run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Install the required Python libraries. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy scikit-learn
    ```


## Reproducing Figures
Run the entire code to reproduce figures 4 and 5 from the paper as well as figures of the Birks quenching correction for all 6 samples.
